# Spectra CuDD version
This repository contains a heavily modified version of the CUDD library wrapped as a Visual Studio C++ project, forked originally from http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/. This version contains GR(1) synthesis specific code and is built into a dynamic library (`cudd.dll`) which is dynamically loaded by the Java code in the synthesizer.

For further information about the Spectra synthesizer and language, please visit spectra-synt repository.
